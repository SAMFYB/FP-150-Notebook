# Lecture 20 - Game Theory

## Modular Framework for the following kinds of Games

- 2-player (alternate turns)
- deterministic (no dice)
- perfect information (no hidden state)
- zero-sum (I win, you lose; ties OK)
- finitely-branching (maybe even finite)

## Game Trees

- __Nodes__ represent current "state of game"
- __Edges__ represent possible moves
- A given __level__ corresponds to a given player, alternating turns
