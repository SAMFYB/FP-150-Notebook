# Functional Programming 15-150 Notebook

This is my notebook for Carnegie Mellon 15-150 Principles of Functional Programming. The notes may be incoherent and incomplete. Yet, I decide to make this public so people might find it useful.

There are more actual source codes in my repo [SML Collection](https://github.com/SAMFYB/SML-collection).

> PDF version of the notes are in the `pdfs` folder.

> Note: If you're viewing this as a webpage, I recommend [View on GitHub](https://github.com/SAMFYB/FP-150-Notebook) or get the PDF versions on GitHub. This is because the SVG images in the notes are NOT rendered correctly on webpages.
